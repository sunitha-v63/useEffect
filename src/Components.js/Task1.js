        <h4>useEffect Hook </h4>
        <p>useEffect is a React Hook that lets you perform side effects in function 
components. Side effects include tasks that happen outside the component's 
rendering, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, or modifying the DOM. 
useEffect runs after the component renders and can re-run when dependencies 
change. </p>
